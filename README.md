# Basic-Soccer-Poisson-Model
Python Poisson Model to predict winners of various soccer matches. Fitting the estimates to a linear regression to better quantify the predictions. Missing ideal betting statistics, but does better than random.

## Caution
Using a purely basic Poisson model to predict soccer matches (and over unders) should not be used. A better approach would be to use a classification algorithm instead.

This project of mine have been retired since 2019 before COVID-19 outbreak. I believe the model could be improved by inputting various other factors other than just home and away teams.
